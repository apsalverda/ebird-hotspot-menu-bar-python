# eBird recent hotspot observations

### Introduction

This script uses your eBird API key and the location code for a specific hotspot to display a list of recent observations.

The output is nicely formatted to include total species count, total count for today, total count prior to today, and checklist timestamps.

### macOS menu bar

This script's output can easily be linked to a macOS menu bar icon using [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus).

I'm planning to post detailed instructions for creating the menu bar item. Feel free to reach out if you need help creating it.
